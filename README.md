# ThermalUAV2UAV dataset
This repository contains a dataset of thermal images representing UAVs.

There are four types of quadcopters and two types of hexacopters in the dataset. All images were acquired by a DJI Zenmuse XTS, mounted on board a DJI Matrice 210 RTK drone.

The dataset is already supplied divided into train sets, validation sets and test sets. All three folders contain an image folder and a label folder, in YOLO format.

## Experiments 

In addition, there is the notebook containing the experiments conducted on the dataset, using various models and versions of You Only Look Once (YOLO).

## Coming soon...

In the future, a paper will be published in which the dataset is presented and the results of the experiments conducted on it will be reported.
